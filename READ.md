//TODO//You need to implement following methods:
//        entrySet - the method is partially implemented.
//        It returns an AbstractSet and you must only provide implementations for its iterator next and hasNext methods.
//        get - return a value by its key.
//        put - set a value by a given key.
//        If it leads to exceeding capacity, be sure to evict as many of the oldest elements as needed.
//        remove - removes a value by key.
//        size - returns number of map entries.
